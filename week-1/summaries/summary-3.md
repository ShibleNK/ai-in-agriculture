## Introduction
As smart machines and sensors become common on farms, agriculture is becoming increasingly **data-driven**. Rapid progress in the **Internet of Things (IoT)** and **Cloud Computing** is pushing the move toward **Smart Farming**, where systems can monitor conditions in real time and support (or automate) farm decisions. Big Data technologies are central to this shift because they enable the collection, storage, processing, and analysis of large, fast, and diverse agricultural data.

Big Data is commonly described as information assets with high **volume**, **velocity**, and **variety** that require specialized technologies and analytical methods to turn data into value.

Because both Big Data and Smart Farming are still relatively new, knowledge about real-world applications and implications is not yet widely established. Some view Big Data as “hype,” while others argue it may already be moving past the “peak of inflated expectations” (as described in Gartner’s Hype Cycle). In any case, the field evolves quickly and any state-of-the-art summary can become outdated soon after publication.

## Why Big Data matters in Smart Farming
Smart devices extend traditional tools (rain gauges, tractors, notebooks) by adding:
- Sensors for continuous measurement of the environment
- Built-in intelligence and context awareness
- Ability to perform autonomous actions or be controlled remotely

Human expertise remains important, especially for validation and decision oversight, but routine operational activities are increasingly delegated to machines.

Big Data supports smart farming across a spectrum of complexity, such as:
- Simple feedback control (example: thermostat-like regulation)
- Advanced analytics and AI (example: deep learning-based crop protection strategies)

## Methodology (Literature Review)
The authors conducted a systematic literature review covering **January 2010 to March 2015**, using a three-step process:

### Step 1: Database Search (Peer-reviewed literature)
- Databases used:
  - Web of Science
  - Scopus
- Keywords were combined from two groups:
  - Big Data terms: “Big Data”, “data-driven innovation”, “data-driven value creation”, “internet of things”, “IoT”
  - Farming terms: “agriculture”, “farming”, “food”, “agri-food”, “precision agriculture”
- Initial results:
  - **613** peer-reviewed articles retrieved
- Screening method:
  - Identify paragraphs containing the keywords
  - Read context to determine relevance to research questions
  - Screening performed by **four researchers** (about 150 articles each), coordinating via **Endnote X7**
- Screening outcomes:
  - **20** “most relevant”
  - **94** “relevant”
  - Remaining articles considered irrelevant

### Step 2: Inclusion of Grey Literature
Because the peer-reviewed body of work was limited (expected for a new and rapidly evolving topic), the review also included grey literature:
- Sources:
  - Google Scholar
  - LexisNexis
- Results collected:
  - 3 reports
  - 225 magazine articles
  - 319 blogs
  - 19 Twitter items
- Further filtering:
  - Blogs: 319 → 29 shortlisted → **9** deemed relevant after deeper review
  - Magazine articles: reduced to 25 after duplicates → **9** considered relevant after full reading

### Step 3: Snowballing + Synthesis
- Additional sources were identified by following references from “most relevant” literature (“snowball approach”)
- This added **11** additional articles/web-items
- Extracted information was analyzed and synthesized using a conceptual framework

## Conceptual Framework
A conceptual framework was developed to classify Big Data applications in Smart Farming from a **socio-economic perspective**.

A major complexity is that Big Data applications often require collaboration between multiple stakeholders across the **data value chain**. The framework draws on:
- Chain/network management literature
- Data-driven strategy literature

It is influenced by Lambert and Cooper (2000), where network management includes three interrelated elements:
- Network structure
- Business processes
- Management components

In this review, the **business processes** layer focuses on the generation and use of Big Data in farming processes. The authors subdivide this into:
- Data chain
- Farm management
- Farm processes

## Results
(Results are presented in the paper using figures and synthesized analysis based on the conceptual framework)

## Conclusion
Big Data in Smart Farming is still in an **early development stage**. This is supported by:
- A relatively small number of scientific publications
- The need to rely heavily on grey literature for a complete view

Most discussed applications were from **Europe and Northern America**, with expectations that more will emerge from other regions. No geographic analysis was performed in the study.
